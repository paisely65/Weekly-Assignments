Task 2
Six Reasons People Use Python
1.	Software Quality
Users appreciate Python’s readability (it is easy to understand even if you did not write it), and it has superior quality software quality. Its software even supports advanced software reuse mechanisms. 

2.	Developer productivity
A code written in Python has less to type, less to debug, less to maintain after being created. The code is typically one third to one fifth the size of older software such as a Java code or C++.

3.	Program portability
        Python can run unchanged on most computer platforms.

4.	Support Libraries
        Python comes with a feature known as a standard library which supports an array of application level programming tasks. Python can be extended with both homegrown libraries and a vast collection of third-party application support software.

5.	Component Integration
        Python scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application.

6.	Enjoyment
         Simply put, Python is easy to use. Users consider programming with Python pleasurable rather than a chore.
